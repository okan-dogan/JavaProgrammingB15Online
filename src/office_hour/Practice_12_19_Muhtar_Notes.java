Java Practice: Arrays
			   Loops


Array: a vraible that can have multiple data elemnts

		data-type[]  vairableName = {data1, data2, ...}	 // data MUST match with the data type
						// index:	   0      1


				vairableName[0] ==> data1
				vairableName[1] ==> data2


for each loop: is used to access each data in the collections of data (array)
			it's a loop that's already been iterated
			numbers of execution of the loop depends on the numbers of data elemnbts

			for(data-type  each : ArrayName  ){

			}
			varoable "each" represents each elemnts of the array


			EX:
				int[] arr = {0,0,0}	;
				for(int each: arr){
						sout(each);  // gets executed 3 times, lenght of the array is 3
				}

		when do we need for each loop:
				we dont need use index numbers


continue statement: used to skip the current iteration of the loop. jumps to the next iteration.

break statement: exiting the loop IMMEDIETLY
