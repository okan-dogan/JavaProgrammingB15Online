Practice Topic: OOP Abstraction
abstract: not concrete
abstraction: focusing on the importance/ Essentials, without worrying the implementation
                hiding the implemtation/functionality details
        class car{
            start();
        }
        class Tesla extends car{
            start(){
                say"start"
                start engine
            }
        }
        class Toyota extends car{
            start(){
                push button
                start engine
            }
        }
        class Jeep extends car {
            start(){
                call the machanic
                oil change
                jump start
            }
        }
abstract method: a method without the implementation  (body)
                method that's meant to be overriden ( cannot be static, final, private)
                public abstract return-type  methodName();
                if the sub class of abstract class is none abstract, then sub class MUST override the abstract method
        two ways to achive abstraction is : 1. Abstract class
                                            2. Interface
Abstract class: a class that's meant to be inherited  ( abstract class cannot be  cannot be final)

        not  concrete: cannot create object from abstract class
