Practice topic: Methods

methods: grouping a series of statements together to perform a specific action

		methods can make our codes more reusable (don't need to repeat same set of statements)


method Decleration:

		access-modfiers  specifiers  return-Type  name(parameters){
				statements...;
		}

		during this course:
			access-mdofiers: public, protected, default, private

			specifiers: static, final, abstract

			return-type(mandatory): void, any  data-types(all primitives or non primitives)

			parameters: any  data-types(all primitives or non primitives)


		for Now we will only use public and static for the access midifier and specifier


		if return-type is void: does not return any value

		if return type is not void: the method MUST return a value
									the returning value MUST be matched with the return-type of the method


		Methods with parameters: sometime method needs specific information (from the user) to perform its function

			the argument that we are passing MUST match with parameter's data type


return statement: it's used for exiting the current method.  we can also use return statement to return a vlaue from the method
