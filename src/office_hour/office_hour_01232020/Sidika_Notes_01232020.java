/*
Constructor: special method/ belongs to the object
Most use case of constructor is
	to provide inititial state (attribute values)
	for the object while being created
1. every class must have constructor.
	if there isn;t any, compiler will give no-arg constructor by default.
2. Constructor method cannot have return types or constructor by default
	return types: primitives,wrapper class, objects
	specifiers: final, static,abstract
3. Constructor name must be same with the class name
4. constructor execution depends on the creation of the object
5. constructor can only be called in other constructor.
	(methods or blocks cannot call constructor)
6. constructor cannot be called by constructor name, must be called with this or super keyword
	this(): calls the class's constructor
	super(): calls the super class' constructor
7. constructor cannot call or contain itself
8. constructor cannot call more than one constructor
9. constructor call must be the first step
10. class' object must be created with existing and visible constructors.
11. super class' default constructor (no-arg) is called in
	sub class' constructor (any constructor) by default.
12. at least one of the super class' constructors must be called in sub class.
	if you want to call more than one constructors from super class create a new constructer for each.
13. Constructor can be overloded.
