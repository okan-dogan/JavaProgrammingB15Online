Practice Topics: Static & instance
				 Constructor


Static: belong to the class. can be called through the class name

			4 features can be static (class member):
									1. static variables (class variables)
									2. static methods
									3. static Initializer block
									4. static class


static variables: there is only one copy of static variables that's shared by all the object of the class

instance variable: belong to the object
				each object has its own copy of instance variable


static methods:  only accepts class members
				in order to call instances (none static) we MUSt create the object

Local Variables: declared within a method or block
					cannot be used outside the method or block


Constructor: special method.  used for creating object
			EVERY CLASS MUST HAVE A Constructor
					if we don't create one, compiler will give no-arg constructor

			Execution depends on the creation of the object

		declaration:
				Access-Modifier  ClassName(Parameter){

				}



creating object:
		ClassName	Referencename = new ExistingConstructor


next week: super & this
