/*
1. write a method called ConsecutiveNums that given a positive integer N,
prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However,
any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word "Codility",
"Test" or "Coders" respectively. If a number is divisible by more than
one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced
by a concatenation of the respective words "Codility", "Test" and "Coders"
in this given order
			Ex:
				input: ConsecutiveNums(12);
				output:
					1
					Codility
					Test
					Codility
					Coders
					CodilityTest
					7
					Codility
					Test
					Codi1ityCoders
					11
					CodilityTest
	2. write a method that accepts arguments "numerator" and "denominator",
	and prints the result of numerator divided by denominator
	(Assume that numerator is greater than denominator),
	the result should not contain any decimals, if there is any remainder left,
	should be printed out as well.
						Warning: DO NOT USE: Math class
									/, * and % operators
			Ex:
				inpuut:
						devideTwoNums(10, 3);
				output:
					 result: 3 with a reminder 1
				input:
					devideTwoNums(15, 3);
				output:
					5
	3. write a return method that returns a String array.
	the method accepts two arguments one is string array ,
	and the other one is string variable.
	the functionality of the method is to remove all the indexes of the String array
	that are matching with the given string variable
			Ex:
				input:
					String[] arr = {"Ahmed","Erick","John", "Mike", "Ahmed"};
					arr = Remeove(arr, "Ahmed");
				output:
					arr ==> {"Erick","John", "Mike"}
				input:
					String[] arr = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"};
						arr = Remeove(arr, "C");
				output:
					arr ==>{ "A", "B", "D", "E" };
