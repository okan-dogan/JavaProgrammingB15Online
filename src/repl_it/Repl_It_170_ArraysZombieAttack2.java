/*
An array inhabitants represents cities and their respective populations.
For example, the following arrays shows 8 cities and their respective populations:
[3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 1]
Some cities have a population of 0 due to a pandemic zombie disease
that is wiping away the human lives.
After each day, any city that is adjacent to a zombie-ridden city will lose
half of its population.

Write a program to loop though each city population and
make it lose half of its population if it is adjacent(right or left)
to a city with zero people until all cities have no humans left.
Make updates to each element in the array And print the array like below
for each day:
Day 0 [3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 0]
Day 1 [3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0]
Day 2 [3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Day 3 [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0]
Day 4 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
---- EXTINCT ----

Write the program in a way that it will handle any number of people in cities,
above was just an example numbers to follow.

Hint:
Below expression will print array in this format:

[3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 0]

Code:
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(inhabitants)));
