/*
This method calculates a water bill, the method gets a double and returns a double.

The more water you use the more it will cost you (as a fine for wasting water).

for example:

waterTax(50)
returns 30

waterTax(55)
returns 49.5

waterTax(101)
returns 140.9

waterTax(151)
returns 235.9

the regular calculation under 50 is
bill = units * 0.60;
above 50 is:
bill = units * 0.90;

above 100 the calculation is like above 50 but with a 50 as fine

and above 150 its the same as above 50 (units *0.90) but with a 100 fine added to the price .
