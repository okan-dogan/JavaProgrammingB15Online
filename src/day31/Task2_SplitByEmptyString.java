We learned that split come with 2 version.
It split String into pieces according to given separator and result in String Array.
What if we put a separator as empty String as below :
"Hello".split("")  -->> {"H", "e", "l", "l", "o"}
What just Happened?
It turned the String hello into a String array containing each character.
It means ,There is symbolic nothing in between characters of any String.
We can already get each character array by using toCharArray() to get char array
This one will generate String array containing each character rather than char array.
With this hack in mind, OPTIONALLY
Create a program that store your String into String array with 3 items :
{ first character , second character, and the rest}
